title: activemodel Gem for Ruby Confirmation Attribute Validator Bypass
date: 2012-11-05
description: |
  activemodel Gem for Ruby contains a flaw that is due to the confirmation
  validator failing to properly trigger if the _confirmation attribute is
  set to nil. This may allow a context-dependent attacker to bypass the
  validator.
